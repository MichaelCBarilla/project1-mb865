## Installation Guide

## Technologies Used
### Flask
Flask is a python framework that is used here to serve the main webpage for the application. After importing the library in `app.py`, the instance is created as `app`. The route decorator is then used to determine what happens when the `/` endpoint is called upon the server.

### Miscellaneous
* `https://fonts.google.com/` is used to select a font family.
* `https://uigradients.com/` is used to obtain the css code for the gradient background
